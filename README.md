# The 3-Point Revolution: Is Volume Actually Winning Games?

This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It investigates whether the modern NBA trend of prioritizing 3-point shots leads to more wins, or if teams are hitting a ceiling with diminishing returns. The goal is to uncover how 3-point shooting volume correlates with team success and whether there's an optimal range for attempts.

## Business Task

A sports data consulting firm is advising several NBA front offices on long-term strategy. Theyâ€™ve asked for a data-driven investigation into the rise of 3-point shooting in the league.

> **Do NBA teams that attempt more 3-point shots actually win more games, or is there a point where the return on volume tapers off?**

The goal is to identify whether teams should continue increasing 3-point volume or focus more on efficiency and shot selection.

## Project Structure (Google Case Study Steps)

1. **Ask** â€“ Define the business problem, target metrics (3PA, 3P%, wins), and stakeholders  
2. **Prepare** â€“ Gather team-level data across multiple seasons from reputable basketball sources  
3. **Process** â€“ Clean and merge datasets, engineer metrics like 3PAr (3-point attempt rate)  
4. **Analyze** â€“ Identify trends, run correlations, and detect efficiency thresholds  
5. **Share** â€“ Visualize findings using Python and Tableau  
6. **Act** â€“ Recommend team strategies and suggest follow-up investigations
