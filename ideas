create visualization of 3PA rise since XXXX. Add a little "steph drafted" annotation where it spikes 
create a similar chart but with each team 

Explain that you dont need a data analyst to tell you 3PA is on the rise but does it even help the team

Some Hypothesis
- maybe there is a correlation with wins if the team has a single good 3p shooter
- maybe they need 2-3 3p shooter for it to work
- do some more in depth analysis like say that 40% isnt really elite anymore when compared to how many players can shoot. 
like show the diff on how 40% was X% point above the average but now it only Y% points
